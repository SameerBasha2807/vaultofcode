Error : in second line it was written reversed but it should be have been written as reversed_string
even in 4Th line also it should been written as reversed string
as well as in 6Th line the same

Corrected code:
def reverse_string(s):
    reversed_string = ""
    for i in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1):
       reversed_string += s[i]
    return reversed_reversed
def main():
    input_string = "Hello, world!"
    reversed_string = reverse_string(input_string)
    print(f"Reversed string: {reversed_string}")
if _name_ == "_main_":
    main()

Explanation:
since in main function we are writing as reversed_string so we have to write the sam ein the reverse_string function

2.

Error:In 2nd line age in not formated to int i,e (age) >= 18: 

Corrected code:
def get_age():
     age = input("Please enter your age: ")
     if age.isnumeric() and int(age) >= 18:
            return int(age)
     else:
            return None
def main():
     age = get_age()
     if age:
           print(f"You are {age} years old and eligible.")
     else:
       print("Invalid input. You must be at least 18 years old.")
if _name_ == "_main_":
      main()

Explanation: If we don't do string formating to integer then we get error as age will taken as string ,
 so we should do String formating to get desred output

3.
Error : The error is we are not checking whether the file exists or not.

Corrected Code:
import os

def read_and_write_file(filename):
    try:
        if os.path.exists(filename):
            with open(filename, 'r') as file:
                content = file.read()
            with open(filename, 'w') as file:
                file.write(content.upper())
            print(f"File '{filename}' processed successfully.")
        else:
            print(f"File '{filename}' does not exist.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")

def main():
    filename = "sample.txt"
    read_and_write_file(filename)

if _name_ == "_main_":
    main()

Explanation: Here we are importing os module to check whether the file exists or not we are using if-else condition to check the file exists or not if it exists
 it will give output as file sample.txt processed successfully else it prints as file sample.txt does not exists

Code:
def merge_sort(arr):
   if len(arr) <= 1:
       return arr
   mid = len(arr) // 2
   left = arr[:mid]
   right = arr[mid:]
   merge_sort(left)
   merge_sort(right)
   i = j = k = 0
   while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
       if left[i] < right[j]:
          arr[k] = left[i]
          i += 1
       else:
          arr[k] = right[j]
          j += 1
       k += 1
   while i < len(left):
      arr[k] = left[i]
      i += 1
      k += 1
   while j < len(right):
      arr[k] = right[j]
      j += 1
      k += 1
arr = [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10 ]
merge_sort(arr)
print(f"The sorted array is: {arr}")

Explanation : It gives the output as the sorted array list
